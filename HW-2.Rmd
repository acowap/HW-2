## Question 1:

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `profiles` data set,
specifically on the relationship between gender and

* `income`
* `job`
* One more categorical variable of your choice

all keeping in mind in HW-3, you will be fitting a logistic regression to
predict a user's gender based on these variables.

###Sex vs. Income
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}

profiles2 <- profiles %>% filter(!is.na(sex)) %>% 
  mutate(income2 = ifelse(income == -1, "Rather Not Say", income)) %>% 
  mutate(income3 = factor(income2, levels = c("Rather Not Say", "20000", "30000", "40000", "50000", "60000", "70000", "80000", "90000", "100000", "150000", "250000", "500000", "1000000"))) %>% 
  mutate(job2 = ifelse(is.na(job), "na", job)) %>% 
  mutate(diet2 = ifelse(is.na(diet), "na", diet))


profilesincome <- profiles2 %>% group_by(income3, sex) %>% tally(sort = TRUE)

#ggplot(data = profilesincome, aes(x = n, y = income3)) + facet_wrap(~sex) + geom_point() 

ggplot(data = profiles2, aes(x = income3, fill = sex)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(x = "Income", y = "Count") + coord_flip()

profiles2_not <- profiles2 %>% filter(income3 != "Rather Not Say")

ggplot(data = profiles2_not, aes(x = income3, fill = sex)) + geom_bar(position = "dodge") + 
  labs(x = "Income", y = "Count") + coord_flip()

ggplot(data = profiles2, aes(x = income3, fill = sex)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + geom_hline(yintercept = .4023) + labs(x = "Income", y = "Percent") + coord_flip()
```

Based on these graphs, we can see that men are more likely than women to make $70,000 a year or more (besides a yearly salary of $1,000,000, but because it is self reported that statistic might be skewed). More women than men would rather not say what their salary is. 

###Sex vs. Job
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}

profilesjob <- profiles2 %>% group_by(sex, job2) %>% tally(sort = TRUE) %>% filter(sex == "f") %>% 
  mutate(order_job = (1:22))


profiles3 <- full_join(profiles2, profilesjob, by = "job2") %>% mutate(sex = sex.x)

ggplot(data = profiles3, aes(x = reorder(job2, order_job), fill = sex)) + geom_bar(position = "stack") + coord_flip() + labs(x = "Job", y = "Count") 

ggplot(data = profiles3, aes(x = reorder(job2, order_job), fill = sex)) + geom_bar(position = "fill")  + geom_hline(yintercept = .4023) + coord_flip() + labs(x = "Job", y = "Percent") 


```
Most jobs are equally distributed among men and women. The three jobs that have the largest female presence are clerical/administrative, education/academia, and medicine/health. The jobs with the smallest percentage of women seem to be construction/craftsmenship, military, and computer/hardware/software. However, since the data set is from San Fransisco where a lot of individuals work in the Tech/computer industry, the percentage in that industry could easily be skewed by pure numbers. 


###Sex vs. Diet
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
profilesdiet <- profiles2 %>% group_by(sex, diet2) %>% tally(sort = TRUE) %>% filter(sex == "f") %>% 
  mutate(order_diet = (1:19))

profiles4 <- full_join(profiles2, profilesdiet, by="diet2") %>% mutate(sex = sex.x)

ggplot(data = profiles4, aes(x = reorder(diet2, order_diet), fill = sex)) + geom_bar(position = "stack") + coord_flip() + labs(x = "Diet", y = "Count")

ggplot(data = profiles4, aes(x = reorder(diet2, order_diet), fill = sex)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + geom_hline(yintercept = .4023) + coord_flip() + labs(x = "Diet", y = "Percentage")

```

A vast majority of people say that they eat some variation of "anything", though if they do have a dietary restriction they are most likely to be "mostly vegitatian". Dietary habits don't seem to be particularly gendered one way or the other, though more women are vegitarian/vegan than men. It seems like more men than women are koser or halal, though that is a dangerous assumption to make since we have so few observations in our data set. 

## Question 2:

In the file `HW-2_Shiny_App.Rmd`, build the Shiny App discussed in Lec09 on
Monday 10/3: Using the `movies` data set in the `ggplot2movies` data set, make a
Shiny app that

* Plots budget on the x-axis and rating on the y-axis
* Instead of having a radio button to select the genre of movie (`Action`,
`Animation`, `Comedy`, etc), have a radio button that allows you to toggle
between comedies and non-comedies. This app should be simpler.
